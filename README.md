## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Questions for clients (Q1)

## Questions for clients (Q3)
- For simplicity, this system only takes into record of customers that are already in the Starbucks Customer System. Therefore, the purchase method takes in their ID
- I'm assuming new customers will be added to the customer system in order to use purchase method
- Do you want the coffee type to change depends on how often this customer orders it? I haven't taken into account that aspect
